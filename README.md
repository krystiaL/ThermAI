# ThermAI
### The Comfort Guard

This is a personal project aiming to create a model that predicts whether the clothing ensembleâ€™s insulation value will provide the optimal thermal comfort outdoors.

ThermAI is built to perform the following tasks:
- Classify individual garment.
- Predict individual garment clo based on garment insulation values. 
- Predict the total clothing ensemble clo by summing individual garment clo value.
- Predict thermal comfort based on the daily weather.
